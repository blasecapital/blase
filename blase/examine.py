class Examine():
    """
    Provides tools for inspecting and visualizing batched datasets.

    The `Examine` class enables users to analyze data quality, distributions, and patterns
    during the preprocessing pipeline. It is designed to work with batched datasets and can
    either report insights on a per-batch basis or aggregate information across multiple batches
    for comprehensive analysis.

    Core Features:
    --------------
    - Generate batch-wise and cumulative summary statistics
    - Visualize distributions, correlations, outliers, and missing values
    - Support numerical, categorical, text, image, and audio data
    - Easily integrate with data extracted using the `Extract` class
    - Uses Matplotlib for clear and customizable plots

    Usage:
    ------
    >>> examine = Examine(aggregate_batches=True)
    >>> for batch in extractor.load_csv("data.csv", batch_size=1000):
    >>>     examine.process_batch(batch)
    >>> examine.generate_summary()

    Parameters:
    -----------
    aggregate_batches (bool): Whether to track and report stats across all processed batches

    Notes:
    ------
    - When `aggregate_batches=True`, cumulative metrics will be computed over all batches
    - Visualizations can be called per batch or after full dataset processing
    - For large datasets, automatic sampling may be used in plots
