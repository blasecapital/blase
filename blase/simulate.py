class Simulate:
    """
    Generates agent-environment interaction data by running policy simulations in configurable environments.
    Supports offline RL data generation, imitation learning, and curriculum-based training.

    The `Simulate` module orchestrates agent behavior within an environment to collect structured training data,
    typically formatted as (state, action, reward, next_state, done) transitions. It supports episodic simulations,
    agent-policy integration, metric logging, and saving outputs in formats compatible with downstream training.

    This module is framework-agnostic and supports OpenAI Gym-style environments, custom environments,
    single-agent and multi-agent workflows, curriculum learning setups, and different action selection strategies.

    Key Responsibilities:
    ---------------------
    - Load and manage RL environments (gym-style or custom).
    - Interface with user-defined agent models or policies.
    - Run multiple episodes of agent-environment interaction.
    - Collect and store transitions for training (offline or online).
    - Track reward metrics, episode length, and environment config.
    - Enable reproducibility via seeding, hashing, and metadata logs.

    Core Methods:
    -------------
    load_environment(env_id: str, config: Optional[dict] = None, seed: Optional[int] = None)
        Load a single or multi-agent environment, with optional config overrides.

    set_agent(agent: Any)
        Register an agent or policy with a `.predict(state)` or `.act(state)` method.

    run_episodes(n: int, epsilon: float = 0.0, max_steps: Optional[int] = None)
        Simulate episodes, log transitions, and compute metrics.

    save_transitions(path: str)
        Save collected transitions in a binary format (e.g., .npy, .json, .npz).

    save_episode_log(path: str)
        Save per-episode metadata (reward, length, seed, termination) to disk.

    save_metadata(path: str)
        Log simulation settings, environment version, agent reference, etc.

    Optional Extensions:
    --------------------
    - **Multiple Environments**: Support curriculum learning or environment sampling strategies.
    - **Multi-Agent RL**: Track and coordinate simultaneous agent policies in shared environments.
    - **Action Sampling Strategies**: Add support for Îµ-greedy, entropy-based sampling, or stochastic exploration.
    - **Curriculum Learning**: Dynamically modify environment difficulty or task during simulation.
    - **Callbacks & Hooks**: Support custom callback functions for visualizations, early stopping, or metric reporting.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> sim = Simulate()
    >>> sim.load_environment("CartPole-v1", seed=42)
    >>> sim.set_agent(RandomAgent())
    >>> sim.run_episodes(n=100, epsilon=0.1)
    >>> sim.save_transitions("data/rl/cartpole_transitions.npz")
    >>> sim.save_episode_log("logs/cartpole_episode_stats.json")
    >>> sim.save_metadata("logs/simulation_config.json")

    Notes:
    ------
    - Designed primarily for RL workflows, but can also support imitation learning data collection.
    - For online RL, this module can be looped with `Train` to update agent policy between episodes.
    - Output formats are designed to be compatible with `Prepare` or used directly by `Train`.
