class Train:
    """
    Trains machine learning models on preprocessed data using a variety of supported frameworks,
    while ensuring reproducibility, efficiency, and production-readiness.

    The `Train` module handles batch-wise training of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models,
    with optional support for cross-validation, checkpointing, and fine-tuning pre-trained models. It provides a
    high-level API that works across TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other supported ML libraries, while allowing users
    to pass in custom model architectures, losses, and training routines.

    This module emphasizes local, memory-efficient execution by streaming data in batches from binary formats 
    such as `.npy`, `.npz`, or `.tfrecord`, aligning with `blase`'s design philosophy. Training metadata,
    hyperparameters, and model checkpoints are logged using an internal hashing and tagging system to ensure
    that every training run is reproducible and easily auditable.

    Core Responsibilities:
    ----------------------
    - Load and manage preprocessed training data in chunks.
    - Train models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or user-defined frameworks.
    - Support checkpoint training, fine-tuning, or starting from scratch.
    - Apply K-fold cross-validation for validation robustness.
    - Track performance metrics (loss, accuracy, reward, etc.).
    - Log training state, hyperparameters, model hashes, and results.
    - Save production-ready model artifacts and reproducible metadata.

    Core Methods:
    -------------
    set_model(model: Any, framework: str = "tensorflow")
        Register a model object, along with its framework type.

    configure_training(optimizer: Any, loss_fn: Any, metrics: Optional[List[Any]] = None)
        Define the training components for supervised/unsupervised learning.

    set_mode(mode: str = "from_scratch", checkpoint_path: Optional[str] = None, freeze_layers: Optional[List[str]] = None)
        Specify training mode: start from scratch, checkpoint training, or fine-tune a pre-trained model.

    run_k_fold(k: int = 5, shuffle: bool = True, seed: Optional[int] = None)
        Train using K-fold cross-validation, storing metrics and models per fold.

    train(epochs: int, callbacks: Optional[List[Callable]] = None)
        Execute the training loop over loaded data.

    save_model(path: str)
        Save the trained model for downstream evaluation or deployment.

    save_logs(path: str)
        Save logs, hyperparameters, hashes, and model metadata.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> trainer = Train()
    >>> trainer.set_model(MyModel(), framework="tensorflow")
    >>> trainer.configure_training(optimizer="adam", loss_fn="categorical_crossentropy")
    >>> trainer.set_mode(mode="fine_tune", checkpoint_path="models/base_model.h5", freeze_layers=["conv1", "conv2"])
    >>> trainer.train(epochs=10)
    >>> trainer.save_model("models/trained_model.h5")
    >>> trainer.save_logs("logs/train_run_001.json")

    Extensibility:
    --------------
    - Supports both built-in and user-defined training loops and models.
    - Accepts custom callbacks for early stopping, logging, visualization, etc.
    - Can be extended to integrate with hyperparameter tuning frameworks (e.g., Optuna).
    - Easily accommodates new ML frameworks by subclassing or backend logic.

    Reproducibility & Productionization:
    ------------------------------------
    - Model weights, configurations, and training parameters are hashed and logged.
    - Checkpoint loading ensures exact reproducibility of resumed training.
    - Logs include framework versions, random seeds, and metadata for auditing.
    - Trained models are saved in a deployable format (e.g., `.h5`, `.pt`, `.pkl`).

    Notes:
    ------
    - Reinforcement learning workflows may use this module to train offline policies,
      or alternate it with `Simulate` for online training loops.
    - Batch-wise training is enforced to support large datasets on local machines.
    - All training metadata is compatible with `Monitor` and `Update` modules.
