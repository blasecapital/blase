class Track:
    """
    Tracks, logs, and manages project-based machine learning runs for reproducibility, modular retracing,
    and metadata storage across the entire `blase` framework.

    `Track` allows users to group disjointed experiments under a shared project and automatically logs
    every main step in the ML workflow (e.g., Extract, Transform, Train, Evaluate, etc.). It supports
    both explicit run control (for power users) and automatic logging behind the scenes.

    Core Features:
    --------------
    - **Project-based structure**: All tracked runs are organized under a common project namespace.
    - **Step-level logging**: Each ML step (prepare, train, etc.) gets its own JSON file for traceability.
    - **Hash-based reproducibility**: Code, arguments, and input references are hashed and stored for recovery.
    - **Custom script capture**: Stores user-defined functions and script files with hash-matched filenames.
    - **Artifact indexing**: Models, preprocessed files, and logs are tied to their originating steps.
    - **Resumable experimentation**: Easily trace previous steps, compare runs, or continue iterations.
    - **Local-first philosophy**: Works entirely offline with optional CLI integration for scripting or agents.

    Method Interface:
    -----------------
    This class is split into two layers:

    - **Public methods** — For users to manage runs, restore past sessions, and compare results.
    - **Protected methods** — Used internally by `blase` modules to automatically log arguments,
      artifacts, scripts, and hashes. Not intended for direct use unless customizing `blase`.

    File Structure:
    ---------------
    When a run is created under a project, it generates:

        /project/
        └── <runs>/
            └── <run_id>_<timestamp>/
                ├── logs/
                │   ├── prepare.json
                │   ├── train.json
                ├── scripts/
                │   └── model_def.py
                └── artifacts/
                    └── model_v1.h5

    Each JSON log contains:
    - Step name
    - Timestamp
    - Hashes of inputs, outputs, and scripts
    - References to prior steps (if any)
    - Status flags (e.g., complete, failed)

    Usage:
    ------
    >>> track = Track(project="diabetes_prediction")
    >>> track.start_run()
    >>> track.start_step("prepare", args={"source": "data.csv"})
    >>> track.log_script("prepare_target.py", func=custom_target_function)
    >>> track.log_artifact("prep_data.npy")
    >>> track.finalize_step()

    CLI Integration:
    ----------------
    The `Track` system is compatible with the `blase` CLI for headless workflows:

        $ blase run --project diabetes_prediction --step prepare

    Notes:
    ------
    - Users can manually control the project and run IDs or let them be auto-generated.
    - Each step is tracked independently but can reference prior hashes for full lineage.
    - Works with disjointed scripts and notebook workflows; not limited to full-pipeline execution.

    See Also:
    ---------
    - `Hash` utility for function and config fingerprinting.
    - `Pipeline` for defining and executing full training sequences.
    - `Prepare`, `Train`, `Evaluate`, etc., which use Track's protected methods internally.
