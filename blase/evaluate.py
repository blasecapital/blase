class Evaluate:
    """
    Evaluates trained models using built-in or user-defined metrics and explainability tools.
    Supports both in-memory prediction and offline evaluation with saved predictions.

    The `Evaluate` module operates on preprocessed data structured by the `Prepare` module
    and works seamlessly with models trained via `Train`. It is designed to support reproducible
    evaluations across a wide range of use cases—classification, regression, RL, and generative tasks.

    Users can run **live evaluations** (predict + assess in memory) or evaluate from **saved predictions**.
    Built-in tools reduce the need for manual coding while enabling custom extension points.

    Core Responsibilities:
    ----------------------
    - Load a trained model from disk.
    - Run predictions on prepared test data (in memory).
    - Apply built-in metric reporters (classification, regression, etc.).
    - Optionally store predictions for reuse or monitoring.
    - Run explainability modules (e.g., SHAP, saliency maps).
    - Support user-defined metrics and explanation functions.
    - Store evaluation logs and hashes for reproducibility and monitoring.

    Usage Patterns:
    ---------------
    - **End-to-End**:
        Use `evaluate_live()` to load the model, generate predictions, apply metrics, and optionally
        explain and save the evaluation — all in one call.

    - **Step-by-Step**:
        Load and run each phase individually for full control:
        >>> evaluator.load_model(...)
        >>> evaluator.predict(...)
        >>> evaluator.print_metrics(...)
        >>> evaluator.visualize_metrics(...)
        >>> evaluator.run_explainability(...)

    Supported Tasks:
    ----------------
    - Classification: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, class breakdowns
    - Regression: MSE, MAE, R², residuals, prediction plots
    - Unsupervised: Silhouette score, clustering summaries
    - Reinforcement Learning: Average return, entropy (future extension)
    - Generative: Placeholder support for BLEU, FID, perplexity (future extension)

    Methods:
    --------
    load_model(model_path: str, framework: str = "tensorflow")
        Load a trained model checkpoint for evaluation.

    predict(test_data_dir: str)
        Run inference over prepared test data and store predictions internally.

    print_metrics(task_type: str = "classification")
        Compute and print evaluation metrics based on predictions and targets.

    visualize_metrics(task_type: str = "classification")
        Generate visual reports (e.g., confusion matrix, calibration plots).

    run_explainability(task_type: str = "classification")
        Apply built-in or custom explainers to interpret model predictions.

    evaluate_live(model_path: str, test_data_dir: str, task_type: str = "classification", save_preds: bool = False)
        Full pipeline for loading model, predicting, scoring, explaining, and optional saving.

    evaluate_from_saved_preds(preds_path: str, targets_path: str, task_type: str = "classification")
        Run evaluation using previously saved predictions and labels.

    add_custom_metric(name: str, metric_fn: Callable)
        Register a user-defined metric for scoring.

    add_custom_explainer(name: str, explainer_fn: Callable)
        Register a user-defined explanation function.

    save_predictions(path: str)
        Save current predictions to disk.

    save_evaluation_logs(path: str)
        Save evaluation results, metrics, and hashes for reproducibility and monitoring.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> evaluator = Evaluate()
    >>> evaluator.evaluate_live(
    >>>     model_path="models/my_model.h5",
    >>>     test_data_dir="data/prepared/test/",
    >>>     task_type="classification",
    >>>     save_preds=True
    >>> )
    >>> evaluator.save_evaluation_logs("logs/eval_run_001.json")

    Notes:
    ------
    - Automatically applies standard metrics based on `task_type`.
    - All evaluations are memory-efficient and batched internally.
    - SHAP/saliency support included where applicable for supported frameworks.
    - Works with models trained using `Train`, and data prepared via `Prepare`.
