class Monitor:
    """
    Tracks live model behavior to detect drift, evaluate ongoing performance, and trigger retraining conditions.

    The `Monitor` class is designed to help users assess how a deployed model behaves in the real world,
    providing support for **feature drift**, **prediction drift**, **performance degradation**, and **triggering retraining alerts**.
    It is intended for use in batch-based systems, but is flexible enough to plug into streaming pipelines.

    This module is compatible with structured and unstructured data, works with supervised or reinforcement learning tasks,
    and integrates tightly with artifacts created during the `Prepare`, `Train`, and `Evaluate` stages.

    Core Capabilities:
    ------------------
    - Detect **drift in feature distributions** (compared to training priors)
    - Detect **drift in prediction distributions** (output class probabilities, logits, etc.)
    - Track **performance metrics** using incoming predictions and ground truth
    - Evaluate **custom or built-in retraining conditions**
    - Store logs and hash summaries for monitoring reproducibility

    Integration:
    ------------
    - Can batch-load live data via the `Extract` class
    - Optionally ingest data directly via `submit_live_batch(...)`
    - Can load training priors and prediction priors for comparison

    Methods:
    --------
    load_feature_priors(path: str)
        Load pre-computed training feature distributions for drift detection.

    load_prediction_priors(path: str)
        Load prior model output distributions (e.g., softmax outputs) for drift detection.

    stream_batches(batch_size: int = 100, source_paths: dict = None)
        Streams aligned batches of features, predictions, and ground truth for live evaluation.

    submit_live_batch(features, predictions, ground_truth)
        Provide a new batch of live model inputs/outputs to be tracked and compared.

    detect_feature_drift(features)
        Compares incoming features to stored priors using statistical methods.

    detect_prediction_drift(predictions)
        Compares new model predictions to saved output priors (optional).

    track_performance_metrics()
        Calculates classification/regression metrics over recent live predictions and truth labels.

    log_drift_metrics()
        Stores current drift status and summary statistics.

    log_performance()
        Stores current performance metrics over live predictions.

    register_trigger(name: str, trigger_fn: Callable[[Dict[str, float]], bool])
        Register a custom retraining trigger based on any metric values.

    check_triggers() -> bool
        Evaluates all active trigger conditions. Returns True if any trigger fires.

    save_alert_log(path: str)
        Stores trigger status and logs for downstream audit/retraining.

    extract_and_monitor(source: str, file_type: str = "csv", batch_size: int = 512)
        Shortcut to load and monitor batches from disk using `Extract`.

    save_monitoring_logs(path: str)
        Write a snapshot of current drift scores, metrics, and trigger flags to disk.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> monitor = Monitor()
    >>> monitor.load_feature_priors("priors/features.json")
    >>> monitor.load_prediction_priors("priors/predictions.json")

    >>> for features, preds, true in stream_batches():
    >>>     monitor.submit_live_batch(features, preds, true)
    >>>     monitor.track_performance_metrics()
    >>>     monitor.detect_feature_drift(features)
    >>>     if monitor.check_triggers():
    >>>         print("Retraining condition met!")

    Notes:
    ------
    - Drift detection supports KS-test, PSI, histogram binning, and custom detectors.
    - All logs and alerts are hash-tagged and timestamped for traceability.
    - This class acts as a bridge between `Evaluate` and `Update`, forming the monitoring layer of your pipeline.
    - For streaming pipelines, batching live data into small windows is still recommended.
