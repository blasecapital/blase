class Pipeline:
    """
    Automates an end-to-end machine learning workflow based on a user-defined configuration file.

    The `Pipeline` class provides a high-level interface for executing the full `blase` training
    process using a single command or script. It wraps the Extract, Transform, Clean, Prepare, 
    Train, Evaluate, and Deploy modules, and allows users to control each step through a YAML or 
    JSON configuration.

    This module is ideal for users who want to reproduce results, run pipelines headlessly (e.g., 
    in production), or simplify experimentation by changing configurations instead of code.

    Features:
    ---------
    - CLI-first design with optional Python usage
    - Compatible with full or partial workflows (e.g., skip `Clean`, `Evaluate`)
    - Accepts user-defined functions or classes for transformations, cleaning, etc.
    - Automatically logs metadata, hashes, and timestamps for reproducibility
    - Modular step-by-step execution with input validation

    Expected Configuration Format:
    ------------------------------
    The config file should be structured with one top-level key per pipeline step.
    Example:
    ```yaml
    extract:
      type: csv
      file_path: "data/input.csv"
      batch_size: 1000

    transform:
      module: "my_module.feature_engineering"
      function: "add_features"

    prepare:
      chunk_size: 1000
      format: "npy"

    train:
      model_type: "tensorflow"
      epochs: 10
      save_path: "models/v1/"

    evaluate:
      metrics: ["accuracy", "calibration"]

    deploy:
      method: "local_bundle"
      output_dir: "deploy/v1/"
    ```

    Parameters:
    -----------
    config_path : str
        Path to the YAML or JSON configuration file defining the pipeline steps.

    Methods:
    --------
    run() -> None
        Executes the pipeline based on the parsed config file.

    validate_config() -> None
        Validates the structure and completeness of the configuration file.

    Notes:
    ------
    - All core pipeline steps are optional and will only run if their section is defined in config.
    - Recommended for production workflows, scheduled training, or reproducible research pipelines.
    - Logs are saved automatically to a timestamped directory under `logs/` unless otherwise specified.

    Example (CLI):
    --------------
    $ blase pipeline --config configs/pipeline.yaml

    Example (Python):
    -----------------
    >>> pipe = Pipeline("configs/pipeline.yaml")
    >>> pipe.run()

    def run(self) -> None:
        """
        Executes the pipeline steps in order as defined in the configuration file.
        """
        pass

    def validate_config(self) -> None:
        """
        Validates the config dictionary to ensure required keys are present and valid.
        """
        pass

    # Pipeline-specific logging should be included in the backend
