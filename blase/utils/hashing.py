class Hash:
    """
    Utility class for generating unique hashes of code, data, files, and directories
    to support reproducibility, change detection, and rollback within the `blase` framework.

    `Hash` enables the `Track` system to uniquely identify and reference everything that contributes
    to a machine learning pipeline â€” from custom functions and config files to model weights and
    preprocessed data artifacts.

    This allows users to:
    - Verify whether pipeline components have changed.
    - Reproduce exact versions of past experiments.
    - Avoid redundant computation by detecting hash collisions.
    - Audit model dependencies across disjointed runs.

    Features:
    ---------
    - Hashes Python functions and classes using source code introspection.
    - Hashes file contents (e.g., CSVs, model files, preprocessed batches) using SHA-256.
    - Hashes serialized objects (e.g., NumPy arrays, configs, dictionaries) for consistency tracking.
    - Recursively hashes directories for end-to-end snapshot integrity.
    - Supports hash comparison and validation across pipeline runs.

    Use Cases:
    ----------
    - Log a function's hash before training to track logic changes.
    - Detect changes to `.npy` or `.csv` inputs before reprocessing data.
    - Compare two tracked runs to determine if code or data changed.
    - Link artifacts to specific pipeline steps using their hash digests.

    Integration:
    ------------
    This utility is called automatically by the `Track` module and can also be used manually
    in custom workflows or analysis tools.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> from utils.hashing import Hash
    >>> hasher = Hash()

    >>> def preprocess(data): return data * 2
    >>> hasher.hash_function(preprocess)
    '9a8b3dcb1a43d...'

    >>> hasher.hash_file("data/batch_01.npy")
    '62ddf742f3a5a...'

    >>> hasher.hash_object({"learning_rate": 0.01, "layers": 3})
    'ab42ed3cb2...'

    Notes:
    ------
    - All hashes use SHA-256 unless otherwise specified.
    - Hashes are deterministic and stable across platforms and sessions.
    - Users are not expected to manage hashes directly, but may do so for advanced use.
